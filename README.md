# Responsive navigation component using all the hooks

the intent is to create a component to return a set of navgation controls based on the current screen size.

This uses Hooks and Context API to provide screen dimentions thoughout the app without prop-drilling / lots of event listeners.

## Running

```bash
npm run start
```

### Edit

this all works but we're using JS to solve a problem that CSS can solve waaaay faster
